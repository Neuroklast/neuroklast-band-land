Neuroklast is hard techno, industrial, DnB, dark electro, whatever breaks the surface. It's noisy, heavy, emotional, sometimes a bit fucked up; just like life. We started this in 2020. Not to fit into a scene, but to build something that feels real. There's a story behind it. A visual world. A lot of weird lore. It's not just for show, but it's part of how we deal with things. Mental health is a big one. Inner shit. No masks. No fake shit. Operating under the darkTunes banner and the mastering of  we continue to develop our sound, we're not stuck to genres. A Neuroklast show is loud, physical and dark, but there's space in it. It's not about being brutal all the time. It's about honesty. If it leaves a mark, good. If not, that's fine too. This isn't for everyone. And it's not trying to be.
